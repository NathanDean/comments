# React/Redux comments app

Deployed to Heroku <a href = "https://young-reaches-78823.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.

A simple app retrieving posts and user data from the JSONPlaceholder API, to practice using Redux with React.

The app uses Axios to make API requests, and Redux Thunk to allow action creators to use asynchronous functions.  It also uses the uniq and map functions from Lodash to prevent overfetching.

This project has given me a better understanding of the role of action creators, middleware and reducers, as well as allowing me to familiarise myself with functions and components such as Provider, connect and mapStateToProps.
